//	drift = 88; // allow this number of frames of drift away from exact synchronisation before attempting to correct it
//	resync_threshold = 2205; // a synchronisation error greater than this will cause resynchronisation; 0 disables it

//  volume_range_db = 60 ; // use this to set the range, in dB, you want between the maximum volume and the minimum volume. Range is 30 to 150 dB. Leave it commented out to use mixer's native range.
